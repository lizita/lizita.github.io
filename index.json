The GLOBAL_ID represents a site and matches up with the concentration data files. Let’s take a closer look at the FIELD_PT_CLASS.\nLA_XY %\u0026gt;% select(FIELD_PT_CLASS) %\u0026gt;% summary() ## FIELD_PT_CLASS ## : 1 ## BH: 11 ## MW:109 ## PZ: 6 ## SG: 30 There are four codes in our data - BH, MW, PZ, SG. You might guess that BH is borehole and MW is monitoring well. I would guess that PZ stands for piezometer and I’m actually not sure what SG stands for. The documentation lists 33 valid values for FIELD_PT_CLASS, but PZ and SG are not on the list.\nThe date on the documentation is 2005, so maybe these codes have been added in the 15 years since then. A disclaimer at the top of the list states that new values are added occasionally, but the link to see the current list is broken :(\nIn any case, we’ll plot these points and see what we can add to make them useful.\nLA_wells_map \u0026lt;- leaflet(LA_XY) %\u0026gt;% addProviderTiles(\u0026quot;CartoDB.Positron\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% #using the CartoDB.Positron tiles; there are other options! addCircleMarkers(lng = ~LONGITUDE, lat = ~LATITUDE, ) #LA_wells_map   Look at that! With just a few lines of code we’ve made a map of points that we can pan and zoom. I was honestly expecting a lot more sites. There are other basemaps that you can use, so take a look at what’s available and pick what’s right for you. At this point my map doesn’t display that much information though, so let’s see what we can improve.\n#make a palette to add colors pal \u0026lt;- colorFactor(topo.colors(5), LA_XY$FIELD_PT_CLASS) LA_wells_map_with_color \u0026lt;- leaflet(LA_XY) %\u0026gt;% addProviderTiles(\u0026quot;CartoDB.Positron\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% addCircleMarkers(lng = ~LONGITUDE, lat = ~LATITUDE, label= ~as.character(FIELD_PT_CLASS), #add a label color = ~pal(FIELD_PT_CLASS)) #add colors #LA_wells_map_with_color  This shows which class the points are and when you hover over the class it shows the class code. If you zoom in to the site near San Gabriel, you can see three monitoring wells (the two close to each other are probably the same one) and a pattern of SG class points that is fairly uniform. The site near El Monte is made up only of boreholes, as is the one near Manhattan Beach.

Also we’ve lost some points - the spatial file had 157 points but when we join it with concentration data we’re left with 69 points.\nOne common way to visualize data with a large range is with a log transformation.

I took out the scale becuse the popup still says the real value but the color is now based on a log value. There seem to be some workarounds for this but I didn’t try them out. There are probably better color schemes out there but that’s like entering another world, so I’ll leave it at this.\nI’m sure that there are many ways to improve this map and build on these concepts in leaflet.

Who wasn’t hungry for a reading group this summer? The first book I signed up to read was Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O’Neil. I recognized it because I had heard an NPR interview with the author on the radio. I actually listened to the audiobook because I wasn’t in Fort Collins and libraries were closed (COVID). It was a really engaging story - basically the whole book is composed of examples of “Weapons of Math Destruction”, or WMDs, a term that O’Neil coins in the first chapted to describe models that are important, opaque, and reinforce inequality.\nThe features of WMDs are highlighted through examples (so many examples!) of real algorithms that are in use every day. But O’Neil doesn’t just throw lots of examples of WMDs at us, she also describes models that have some negative aspects, but are not on the whole that harmful, and models that are sound uses of statistics. It’s complicated and forces you to confront how insidious these algorithms are.\nSomething that surprised me was her discussion of credit scores. I was all ready to jump on board against credit scores, but that wasn’t her conclusion in the book. This is not a WMD. The FICO model has a feedback loop, but it corrects itself rather than perpetuates inequality. If many people who are predicted to be risky borrowers pay on time, the model is updated to account for the new data and make better predictions. In addition, the model is fairly transparent - if you are trying to improve your credit score you can easily look up ways to do so. And credit scores are also regulated, so you have legal rights to see your score and know what goes into it.\nIn stark contrast are ubiquitous e-scores used by credit card companies, car dealerships, and advertising agencies that you probably have no idea exist. These scores are created by models that combine lots of seemingly disparate information about you and predict if you’re likely to buy their product. The problem is that the factors the model uses are proxies like zip code, which means that inequality created by racist zoning laws is perpetuated by an algorithm. Predatory for-profit college lead generation companies use algorithms that target people who are earnestly searching for oppurtunities at upward mobility - and make a fortune doing it.\nAnother outraging story was about scheduling software used by low-wage corporations like McDonald’s, Starbucks, and Walmart. They’re designed to optimize saving for the company, so they create ever-changing and erratic schedules that keep workers from qualifying for benefits. In 2014 the New York Times published an article profiling Jannette Navarro, a Starbucks employee and single mother trying to work her way through college. Her life was so dominated by her work schedule that she couldn’t make her classes consistently or plan for any sort of normal day-care schedule. After the story, legislators drafted a bill to regulate scheduling software but it went nowhere.\nI’ll leave you with most shocking statistic I read, related to the insurance industry.\n \u0026quot;In Florida, adults with clean driving records and poor credit scores paid an average of $1,552 more than the same drivers with excellent credit and a drunk driving convition.\n A seemingly inocuous number created by an algorithm is plugged in to another algorithm for an utterly ridiculous outcome.\nIn the discussion group one person said they were vaguely aware that things like this were happening, but didn’t know the extent or specific examples. It does get somewhat repetitive since the author really pounds the ideas into you with tons of examples, but that didn’t bother me. Another person asked that now that we’ve read the book, what can we do about it? We didn’t come up with a lot of answers - be aware and support policies that regulate them. Are there other actions that people can take to combat the proliferation of Weapons of Math Destruction?\n","date":1596412800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596412800,"objectID":"07c84ad59332cefd5c32921da59b4bd2","permalink":"/post/wmds/","publishdate":"2020-08-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/wmds/","section":"post","summary":"Earlier this summer I got an email about reading groups for grad students hosted by the department of cell and molecular biology.

It’s not so hard to get the data you’re interested in, but pay close attention because it’s easy to do the wrong thing. Probably the easiest way is to use the dataRetrieval package. The last commits on their github are from 2 months ago, so it’s pretty up-to-date.\nTo use this package, you need to know a few things about the structure of the data. Each USGS streamflow station has a number - you’ll need to know the number for the station you want. There’s also a number associated with each measured value; 00060 for discharge in feet per second, 00065 for gauge height in feet, 00010 for temperature in degrees celcius, and many more. The last critical thing to know is the date range of the data you’re interested in.\n Station Number Parameter Code Date Range of Interest  Here’s an example from the documentation:\n#install.packages(\u0026quot;dataRetrieval\u0026quot;) #uncomment to install the package library(dataRetrieval) # Choptank River near Greensboro, MD: siteNumber \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;01491000\u0026quot; parameterCd \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;00060\u0026quot; # Discharge startDate \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;2009-10-01\u0026quot; endDate \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;2012-09-30\u0026quot; discharge \u0026lt;- readNWISdv(siteNumber, parameterCd, startDate, endDate) Here’s what the resulting data frame looks like:\nThe fifth column is a quality code - A stands for approved for release by the USGS.\nAnother notable argument to the readNWISdv function is statCd. This allows you to request daily data and specify the statistic used. For example, you can request the daily maximum, mean, median, or total.\nPretty simple, right?\nThere are some other handy functions and options in this library. You’ll notice that the colunm names aren’t really descriptive of the data. You can use another function from the package to rename them. Try this:\ndischarge \u0026lt;- renameNWISColumns(discharge) names(discharge) ## [1] \u0026quot;agency_cd\u0026quot; \u0026quot;site_no\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Date\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Flow\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Flow_cd\u0026quot; That can clean things up a lot - especially if you’re importing many parameters.\nlibrary(ggplot2) ggplot(discharge, aes(x=Date, y=Flow)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.4) What I am interested is the streamflow data, so this is as far as I need to go. You can also import different kinds of USGS data using other functions of the same package. It’s a treasure trove! Check out the documentation to get the full scope of its powers.\nI also came across another package called waterData that can do the same retrieval and maybe some more analysis on the data. I haven’t looked further into this, but the last commits to their github are from 3 years ago, so I choose the dataRetrieval package.\nNow I’ll let you in on the less fun bit, which is the way I originally tried to download the data locally then upload to R. I started out fumbling around the website trying to find the gauge closest to the site I’m interested in. There’s an interactive map on the homepage; you click on a state to get to a more refined map and click around some more to find the gauge you want.\nYou get to a really promising page that gives you some options to select parameters, a date range, and whether you want the output to be a graph, table, or tab-seperated format. This looks good, but is not.\nI chose the tab-seperated option; After a lengthy wait a new tab with the output opened in the browser - so no file download. I guess I could have copied and pasted all of that into a text file, but I decided to search for a way to actually download the file.\nI found a USGS primer on dowloading data (always read the instructions first!), which took some different turns than the path I took previoulsy. The user interface is difficult to navigate and not intuitive, but it’s a great resource for data. I won’t go through the whole process, because it’s mostly just clicking on the right spot and choosing your desired options, but here is the most important part:\nThere are still extra steps of choosing the options in the website, downloading the data, then reading it into R. This is the code I used to read the data once I had downloaded it as a text file and renamed it “streamflow”. If I were to go back, I would not do it this way, but I guess it doesn’t require downloading a new package and is fine if you’re not dowloading a lot of data.\nlibrary(tidyverse) streamflow \u0026lt;- read.table(\u0026quot;streamflow\u0026quot;, skip = 32) #the first 32 lines are metadata colnames(streamflow) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;agency\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;site_no\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;date\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;time\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;timezone\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Flow\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;quality_code\u0026quot;) #discharge is in cubic feet per second, quality code A means approved streamflow$date \u0026lt;- as.Date(streamflow$date) ggplot(streamflow, aes(x=date, y=Flow)) + geom_point(alpha=0.4) Hope this info helps you avoid wasting time like I did on my first try!

This isn't always the case - be sure to keep an eye out for units and do conversions as necessary before working with the data. The PARVQ tells us if the chemical was detected in the sample or below the detection limit (ND). For 791 of the observations, the chemical was not detected in the sample, while in only 135 observations a true detected concentration is reported.

Benzene has the lowest MCL by far, and it is usually the chemical that drives cleanup. It\u0026rsquo;s a little hard for us to see it on this plot, so let\u0026rsquo;s zoom in some more.\nMWA4_benzene \u0026lt;- MWA4 %\u0026gt;% filter(PARLABEL == \u0026quot;Benzene\u0026quot;) ggplot(MWA4_benzene, aes(x = LOGDATE, y = PARVAL, color = \u0026quot;Benzene\u0026quot;,)) + geom_line() + geom_point(alpha = 0.6) + labs(title =\u0026quot;MWA4\u0026quot;, x =\u0026quot;Date\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Benzene Concentration in ug/L\u0026quot;) + geom_hline(yintercept=5, linetype=\u0026quot;dashed\u0026quot;, color=\u0026quot;red\u0026quot;)  Around 2004 this well has almost seven times the MCL of benzene, but it quickly went down to non-detectable or very low for the rest of the recorded period. If I was especially interested in this site I would try to request some of the accompanying reports and perform a Mann-Kendall analysis of trends in the wells, but mostly I wanted to show how you can download data from Geotracker and manipulate it in R.\nThis tutorial is done entirely in a jupyter notebook running an R kernal inside of a docker container.

I’ve been thinking about this recently, since I would like to see if I can match up weather conditions to the changes in the depth to water of wells at a site. I was inspired to look into this based on a talk from Jonathan Kennel from the Univesity of Guelph ( Happy Canada Day! ) and several conversations with my advisor.\nI’ll walk through how I imported the data to R.\nDark Sky is a great resource, however, when I went to re-visit the website I found that they have joined Apple. This means they are no longer creating new accounts. Luckily I already had one from my class last fall. The API is still supported through at least the end of 2021. Later I’ll mention some ways that you could get similar (maybe better) data through other channels.\nThe API allows up to 1000 calls per day for free. Using the Time Machine you can request data from a certain date and location. I focused on hourly data, though it’s probably finer resolution than I need.\n“The hourly data block will contain data points starting at midnight (local time) of the day requested, and continuing until midnight (local time) of the following day.”\nThe docs include a sample API call, which includes your key, the location, and the date requested.\nGET https://api.darksky.net/forecast/0123456789abcdef9876543210fedcba/42.3601,-71.0589,255657600?exclude=currently,flags\nA quick visit to my best friend stack overflow provided a little more clarity about how to use the API in R. The date is in UNIX format. I wanted to start at January 1, 2000, so I used a handy UNIX converter to find my desired date number, 946684800. I replaced the url and now I’m ready to call the API.\n#GET the url req \u0026lt;- httr::GET(\u0026quot;https://api.darksky.net/forecast/{key}/30.012188,-94.024525,946684800?exclude=currently,flags\u0026quot;) req$status_code # should be 200 if it worked. If you get 400, something has gone wrong. # extract req$content cont \u0026lt;- req$content #Convert to char char \u0026lt;- rawToChar(req$content) #Convert to df df \u0026lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(char) It worked! I removed my private API key, so you’ll have to take my word for it. But now I have a new problem - the call only works for one day at a time. I want a lot of days, so I decided to write a loop.\nOne thing I couldn’t get to work was changing the date inside the string for the API url. I posted in the R for Data Science Slack, and a few minutes later I learned a handy new trick - you can put a variable inside a string by just inserting it with quotes around the variable. Something like this: \u0026quot;https://api.darksky.net/forecast/{key}/30.012188,-94.024525,\u0026quot;,day,\u0026quot;?exclude=currently,flags\u0026quot;\nGreat! I ran the loop and it worked, kinda. It errored out after the first run because rbind could not combine two data frames with different numbers of columns. After looking at the next few days to see which columns were off I saw that it went from 15 to 16 to 17, then back down. Very annoying! They must have added some new info for some days, but this made the data inconsistent so I had to add a select function to the loop. I selected for the 15 columns that were consistent across all days and ran it again. Success!\nHere’s the code I ended up with:\nlibrary(dplyr) #initialize all_hours so there\u0026#39;s something to rbind to df \u0026lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(paste0(\u0026quot;https://api.darksky.net/forecast/{key}/30.012188,-94.024525,946684800?exclude=currently,flags\u0026quot;)) all_hours \u0026lt;- df$hourly$data # make a vector of unix dates I want (minus the first one, which I already put in all_hours) unix_day \u0026lt;- seq(946771200, 1033084800, by=86400) for (day in unix_day){ df \u0026lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(paste0(\u0026quot;https://api.darksky.net/forecast/{key}/30.012188,-94.024525,\u0026quot;, day, \u0026quot;?exclude=currently,flags\u0026quot;)) hourly \u0026lt;- select(df$hourly$data, c(cols)) all_hours \u0026lt;- rbind(hourly, all_hours)} #convert unix time to date all_hours$time \u0026lt;- as.POSIXct(all_hours$time, origin=\u0026quot;1970-01-01\u0026quot;) I selected the columns I want and saved them as weather.csv.

This is probably a more robust dataset anyway, but the downside is that they don’t have the option to use lat/long as a location - you have to pick from one of their existing stations. In my case there wasn’t one near the field site I was interested in, but they’re spread out across the country so I bet it will be a great source for a lot of people. There’s a good tutorial on accessing this data at R Open Sci.\nI’ve also hear the Weather Underground has a good API, but it looks like you need to contribute weather data with an IoT device to access it. Cool! But may not be useful to some.\nAre there any other sources of weather data that you know of? Do you have suggestions to improve the approach I used for the Dark Sky data?\n ","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"34180d604b11b2b43719a4bcc5aa421a","permalink":"/post/weather/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/weather/","section":"post","summary":"In my IoT class last year with Jay Ham we used a website called Dark Sky to get current weather conditions.

Every Tuesday a new dataset is released and people are encouraged to explore, analyse, and visualize it in interesting ways. This is my first week exploring tidy tuesday data. Information about the project and datasets is at the tidytuesday github. Before working with this data I watched Julia Silge’s excellent screencast and picked up some great ways to find missing values and recode data.\nA Little History I learned a lot just by looking at the data provided. I was not previously aware of the history captured in the african_names dataset - which lists the names of enslaved people that were freed as they were being illegally smuggled to the Americas. The most names were recorded at the port of Freetown in Sierra Leone before making the trans-atlantic journey. Here’s the description of the dataset excepted on the tidytuesday github page:\nDuring the last 60 years of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, courts around the Atlantic basins condemned over two thousand vessels for engaging in the traffic and recorded the details of captives found on board including their African names. The African Names Database was created from these records, now located in the Registers of Liberated Africans at the Sierra Leone National Archives, Freetown, as well as Series FO84, FO313, CO247 and CO267 held at the British National Archives in London. Links are provided to the ships in the Voyages Database from which the liberated Africans were rescued, as well as to the African Origins site where users can hear the names pronounced and help us identify the languages in which they think the names are used.\n Table 1: Data summary  Name african_names  Number of rows 91490  Number of columns 11  _______________________   Column type frequency:   character 6  numeric 5  ________________________   Group variables None    Variable type: character\n  skim_variable n_missing complete_rate min max empty n_unique whitespace    name 0 1.00 2 24 0 62330 0  gender 12878 0.86 3 5 0 4 0  ship_name 1 1.00 2 59 0 443 0  port_disembark 0 1.00 6 19 0 5 0  port_embark 1126 0.99 4 31 0 59 0  country_origin 79404 0.13 3 31 0 563 0    Variable type: numeric\n  skim_variable n_missing complete_rate mean sd p0 p25 p50 p75 p100 hist    id 0 1.00 62122.02 51305.07 1.0 22935.25 45822.5 101263.8 199932 ▇▆▃▁▂  voyage_id 0 1.00 17698.25 82016.88 557.0 2443.00 2871.0 3601.0 500082 ▇▁▁▁▁  age 1126 0.99 18.89 8.60 0.5 11.00 20.0 26.0 77 ▆▇▁▁▁  height 4820 0.95 58.61 6.84 0.0 54.00 60.0 64.0 85 ▁▁▂▇▁  year_arrival 0 1.00 1831.40 9.52 1808.0 1826.00 1832.0 1837.0 1862 ▂▆▇▃▁    ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## # Groups: port_disembark [5] ## port_disembark n ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; ## 1 Freetown 81009 ## 2 Havana 10058 ## 3 Bahamas unspecified 183 ## 4 Kingston, Jamaica 144 ## 5 St. Helena 96 From this output we can see that country_origin has the most missing data by far. There’s a clue about this in the description of the data above, which mentions the African Origins site, where users can hear the names pronounced and help identify the languages in which they think the names are used.\nSo the people who were liberated were from such different cultures that the original documentarians could not speak the same language or determine where they originally came from. We can see that about 81,000 people were freed in Freetown (This now makes sense - again learning lots here). About 10,000 people were freed in Havana, Cuba, and many less in other locations in the caribbean.\nThe age variable includes entries from a 6-month old child to a 77 year old person. The gender variable has 12,878 missing values and 4 options. I’ll use some of the same techniques as Julia Silge to clean up this data.\nafrican_names %\u0026gt;% group_by(port_disembark, year_arrival) %\u0026gt;% count() %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(year_arrival)) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x = year_arrival, y = n, color = port_disembark)) + geom_line(alpha = 0.6, size = 2) + geom_point(alpha = 0.6) We can see that the majority of liberations occured in Freetown. I wonder if the ships had stopped going to Freetown by 1849, or if there was less enforcement, or if they stopped being recorded. Similary, I wonder what the policies were in each of the other ports that made them free enslaved Africans for the time periods reflected in this data.\n ","date":1593223994,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593223994,"objectID":"12411e3f680e40565a389c98e4d8e4eb","permalink":"/post/2020-06-26-ttafamhistory/","publishdate":"2020-06-26T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-06-26-ttafamhistory/","section":"post","summary":"If you’re not familiar with Tidy Tuesday, it is a weekly project hosted online by the R for data science community.
